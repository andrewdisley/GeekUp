<p>This month they&#39;ll be three 20:20 style presentations, two of which are confirmed talks (Open Street Map and Eye Tracking) with the third slot left open to all comers. So if you think you have something interesting to talk about that people might benefit from, then prepare it as a 20:20 style presentation, and we&#39;ll leave it open to the audience to decide on the night which one they get to see. Rob has outlined the <a class="external" href="http://geekup.org/wiki/index.php?title=2020Presentations">20:20 format  on the GeekUp wiki</a> but it&#39;s essentially 20 slides, with 20 seconds per slide.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gents, bring your Wii sticks! There&#39;s rumour of some wii action later in the evening!</p>
