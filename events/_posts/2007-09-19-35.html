<p><strong>* We're looking for volunteers for this month's pre-arranged talks, so if you're interested, please do <a class="external" href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/user/57314/sendnote/">get in touch</a> *</strong></p>
<p>This month there'll be three 20:20 style presentations, two of which are pre-arranged, with the third slot left open to all comers. So if you think you have something cool to talk about that you'd like to share, then prepare it as a 20:20 style presentation, and we'll leave it open to the audiencemob to decide on the night who gets to talk. Rob has outlined the <a class="external" href="http://geekup.org/wiki/index.php?title=2020Presentations">20:20 format on the GeekUp wiki</a> but it's essentially 20 slides, with 20 seconds per slide.</p>
<p>So far for scheduled talks we have: <a class="external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/plip/">Phil Winstanley</a>, who will be giving a <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/mix07/">MIX</a> Mastication - a quick tour of what was announced @ <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/mix07/">MIX</a>, what it means, and why you should care, even if you hate Microsoft.</p>
