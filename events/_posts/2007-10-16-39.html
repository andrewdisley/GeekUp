<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>It's time for GeekUp Manchester to find a new home, what better way to do it than to crawl the streets and test out venues.</p>
<p>We'll be departing the B Lounge at 7PM, if you're late you'll have to come hunt us down.</p>
