<p><a class="external" href="http://made-of-stone.blogspot.com/">Rahoul Baruah (aka Baz)</a> will be giving us a 20:20 on "Why Rails programmers are so smug" - an outline of his favourite features of both Ruby and Rails, and how they can help you build web applications quickly and easily.</p>
<p>There's still one scheduled 20:20 slot free so do get in touch if there's something you'd like to get off your chest...</p>
<p>In true tradition we will honour our turn-up-on-the-night-with-a-20:20-slot, where it's left up to the GeekUp crowd to decide on the night who gets to talk. The 20:20 format is outlined on the GeekUp wiki but it's essentially 20 slides, with 20 seconds per slide.</p>
