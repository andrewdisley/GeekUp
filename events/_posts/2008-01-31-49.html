<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>Welcome back to GeekUp '08, in the European capital of geek culture. We have no presentations for our first meeting of the year and we're not in our usual venue, but we'll be meeting and drinking all the same.</p>
