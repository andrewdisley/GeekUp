<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>Please note: This month we've moved this event to Tuesday!</strong></p>
<p>This month we will have a talk on website law from Graham Ross, lawyer and mediator.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Managing disputes with (and thus preserving) customers and suppliers through use of mediation rather than rushing to/away from the law. I can talk about the court project which is the first online mediation project of any court in the world.</li>
	<li>How to spot an illegal website (very large percentage) and a run through of all the laws as they apply to doing business on the web plus laws on privacy and spam. Also how developers/resellers/partners can assess/manage/reduce their own legal risk inherent in the new business models.</li>
	<li>How to expand service as a web developer by arranging to provide, through referral, legal content rather than just the placeholders (terms and conditions, privacy policy etc) and telling clients to find their own lawyer or, worse, cut and pasting somebody else's legals.</li>
</ul>
