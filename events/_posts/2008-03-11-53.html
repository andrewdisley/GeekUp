<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>We&#x27;ve got a new format</strong> - Each week we&#x27;ll announce a topic up for discussion for everyone to get involved around the table, feel free to bring along something to show relating to the topic.</p>
<p><strong>This months Discussion Topic: &quot;Coding Practices&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you use version control, if so which one? When do you use it? Any scare stories of forgetting to?</li>
	<li>Do you test your code? If not, why? What would it take to make you test your code better? What tools do you use?</li>
	<li>Do you spec out your projects? How much? Do you do it religiously? Do you find any benefit?</li>
	<li>Do you practice XP? Pair coding? Agile development? Lean development? TDD?</li>
	<li>How do you run YOUR projects - what works and what doesn&#x27;t?</li>
</ul>
