<p>This month, we are lucky enough to have two 20:20 lightning talks:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://www.sailes.co.uk/">Mark Sailes</a> on "How version control will save the world"</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://xpclub.erudine.com/">Daniel Drozdzewski &amp; David Turner</a> on XP (the Extreme Programming variety)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's just about time to squeeze in an ad-hoc 20:20 if anyone feels the need.</p>
<p>Alas, Rob and I have just booked a snowboarding trip for next week (only time we could go before the snow runs out) so we're leaving GeekUp in the very capable hands of <a class="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nigelmouse/2280034661/">James Hoskins</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/urbanwide/2282008236/">Richard Hamer</a>, and a big thanks to them for taking on the challenge. We are gutted to be missing GeekUp Leeds for the first time, so we hope you will take lots of photos and that the cheeky chappies of the <a class="external" href="http://www.northcrew.co.uk/">NorthCrew</a> will be there with their video camera.</p>
<p>A note about the venue. Richard worked tirelessly to find a venue to match all the GeekUp criteria (believe me, finding a free venue in Leeds is getting increasingly more difficult), so unfortunately we had no choice but to forgo the disabled access for this month and I believe there is wifi available, but it's "patchy". There is a bottle bar in the room we've been allocated but I'm told if you want a proper pint, you're best picking one up in the bar on the way in. There is, however, a pool table!</p>
