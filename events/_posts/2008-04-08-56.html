<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>We've had to make a last minute venue change as Rain Bar is closed for refurbishment - new venue is 100 yards down the road.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This months Discussion Topic: &quot;The Future of the Internet&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>How do you see people using the internet in 5/10 years time?</li>
	<li>What features do you want to see browsers supporting?</li>
	<li>Will people still be using browsers? If not, what will they be using?</li>
	<li>Does anyone actually use 3G video chat? Will VoIP mainstream follow too?</li>
	<li>Will Google always be the number one search engine?</li>
	<li>Will Google be even bigger? Perhaps it might run our lives ...</li>
	<li>Will IPv6 actually be adopted by the masses?</li>
	<li>Anyone up for a 3G wireless dongle biometric implant to hook your memory up to the net?!</li>
	<li>Semantic Web - is it the future? what does it mean?</li>
</ul>
