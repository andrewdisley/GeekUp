<p>The inaugural GeekUp Preston.</p>
<h3>What?</h3>
<p><strong>Gemma Cameron is planning to do a short talk on "Agile and Mission Critical Projects"</strong></p>
<h3>Why so secret?</h3>
<p>The first GeekUp Preston is going to be held at a members own house hence the secrecy, if you would like to attend the first GeekUp Preston please e-mail <a href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#103;&#101;&#101;&#107;&#117;&#112;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#103;&#101;&#101;&#107;&#117;&#112;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> and we'll get back in touch with you.</p>
<p>So it's bring your own booze, or pick some up from a local shop nearby and there will even be a lovely spread!</p>
<p>There are facilities for presentations (need an S-Video port on your lappy) if anyone wants to do one, otherwise the format is going to be quite relaxed and informal for the first meeting.</p>
<p>As there has been so much interest, next month's should be at a more formal, and much less secret, venue.</p>
