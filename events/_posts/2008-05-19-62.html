<p>Due to popular demand for March&#x27;s meeting, GeekUp Preston will now be held upstairs at the beautiful Forum Bar.</p>
<p><strong>What&#x27;s On?</strong></p>
<p>This month we&#x27;ve got <a class="external" href="http://andrewdisley.com/">Andrew Disley</a> doing a &quot;Fix My MarkUp&quot; session for anyone who has any questions about CSS/HTML etc. Bring along your problem and he&#x27;ll try to solve it!</p>
<p>Following on from recent Mailing List discussions and a previous Manchester GeekUp, we&#x27;re going to have a natter about AGILE. Please bring along your questions or anecdotes of what does and doesn&#x27;t work for you and your projects.</p>
<p>And of course anything else you fancy, including laughing at Gem attempting <a class="external" href="http://superfunkrollerdisco.com/">Roller Disco</a>!</p>
