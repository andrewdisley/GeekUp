<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>Two short talks this month:</p>
<p><a class="external" href="http://osfameron.vox.com/">Hakim Cassimally</a>: People like to claim Perl is line noise, with its sigils and regular expressions. But a lot of the features that make it possible to write, yes, truly awful, unreadable Perl, also let you write clean, maintainable code too.</p>
<ul>
	<li>those $%&amp;* sigils!</li>
	<li>There's More Than One Way To Do It</li>
	<li>strings and data structures</li>
	<li>map, grep, first class functions</li>
	<li>metaprogramming and the CPAN</li>
	<li>modern Object Oriented programming with Moose</li>
</ul>
<p>And a talk from <a class="external" href="http://blog.martinowen.net/">Martin Owen</a> on Erlang</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, (you'll need them). 3345 Parr St is not clearly advertised on the street. Use <a class="external" href="http://is.gd/sVvL">Google StreetView</a> to see the door to the bar. It's next to the Parr St Garage.</p>
