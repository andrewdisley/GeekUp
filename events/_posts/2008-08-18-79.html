<p>GeekUp Preston takes place on the <strong>third Monday of every month</strong>. It's a grassroots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in the web and technology industry.</p>
<p>This month if the weather is good we'll be at Avenham Park, sat outside in the sunshine (bring along your own drinks and food). Otherwise we'll be upstairs at Forum bar. You'll see us sat on the park near the Winckley Square entrance, on the hill of the natural amphitheatre.</p>
<p>There should be cake, but Gemma will have been at <a class="external" href="http://barcampleeds.com/">Barcamp Leeds</a> all weekend and may not have time...</p>
