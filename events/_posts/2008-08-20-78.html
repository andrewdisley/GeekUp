<p>GeekUp Leeds takes place on the third Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>We thought we'd have a nice chilled out GeekUp this month in the name of BarCamp rehab! To help us relax, we going to have a bit of a wii night, so bring your wii sticks along if you fancy a game!</p>
<p>If anyone fancies bringing their wii, we're borrowing a second projector.</p>
