<p>GeekUp Sheffield takes place on the first Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>We've surrendered our usual venue this month for the <a class="external"href="http://www.sheffdocfest.com">Sheffield International Documentary Festival</a>.  Instead of huddles and talks, we'll be doing our own screening of a series of short geeky films and animations as a wind-down before the enormity of <a class="external" href="http://barcampsheffield.net/">BarCamp Sheffield</a> at the end of November.</p>
<p>If you have any short geeky films that you've made or think are worthy of the GeekUp Film Festival, then message me or add a comment below.</p>
