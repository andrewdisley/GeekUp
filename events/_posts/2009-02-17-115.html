<p><strong>New Venue!</strong> This month's GeekUp is at the Old Harkers Arms rather than City Bar - it's a bit bigger, a bit brighter and you can hear each other talk. Harkers is 30 seconds walk from the old City Bar venue. Just cross the road from City Bar and go down the steps next to the canal - Harkers is at the bottom of the steps.</p>
