<p><strong>Search Usability</strong> - This talk is an in depth view into "Search Usability", a phrase Craig uses to not only cover traditional SEO, but the associated conversion and funneling processes and content structure concepts. Craig currently works for a leading UK Personal Injury Solicitors so is accustom to working in tough search markets. Talk will start around 7:30</p>
