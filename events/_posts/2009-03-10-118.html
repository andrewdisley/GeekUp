<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>This month <a class="external" href="http://www.adaptavist.com/">Adaptavist</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/">Campaign Monitor</a> have kindly donated some[*] money to put behind the bar for free beer!</p>
<p>[*] There's not a bottomless pit of money but we'll try to accommodate everyone.</p>
<p>Manchester events are purely social, come along and have good chinwag.</p>
