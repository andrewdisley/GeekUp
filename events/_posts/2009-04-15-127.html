<p>GeekUp Leeds takes place on the third Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Pre FOWA Tour MeetUp has merged with GeekUp Leeds for the evening, so come down and meet the good folks from the Carsonified Crew!</strong></p>
<p>This month, GeekUp Leeds will be upgrading it's regular venue and heading up the hill once again to <a class="external" href="http://www.oldbroadcastinghouse.com/">Old Broadcasting House</a> for a one off special.</p>
<p>This time we've managed to entice <a class="external" href="http://blog.ginader.de/">Dirk Ginader</a> of Yahoo! fame up from that London to tell us all about the virtues of <strong>JavaScript Accessibility</strong>.</p>
<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>In the rough early days of the world wide web Dirk Ginader changed his Passion to his Profession and founded the Unit Interactive of a large Advertising Agency in Mainz, Germany.</p>
<p>After nearly 9 Years the Web Standards and Accessibility Enthusiast answered the call of Yahoo! to join the Web Development Team and the Accessibility Task Force in London.</p>
<p>In his Spare time he is developing, speaking and blogging about open source accessible JavaScript and Web Development in General.</p>
<h3>Our Friends</h3>
<p>All this would not be possible without our good friends at <a class="external" href="http://www.ntileeds.co.uk/">NTI</a>. They have very kindly paid for the whole event, including beer and expenses.</p>
<p>NTI offer a fantastic selection of <a class="external" href="http://www.ntileeds.co.uk/courses/">training courses (e.g. Apple, Zend, Red Hat, Prince 2 certifications)</a> and host the excellent co-working space that is known as <a class="external" href="http://www.oldbroadcastinghouse.com/">Met:Space</a> at the very cool Old Broadcasting House.</p>
<p><strong>There will be beer</strong> (and soft drinks)... and afterwards we will no doubt move down to the Dry Dock for yet more beer!</p>
<h3>What about the FOWA Tour?</h3>
<p>Yes, the fabulous FOWA is <a class="external" href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2009/tour">going on tour</a> this year, and Leeds is lucky enough to be one of the hosts... Featuring: Andy McLoughlin, Richard Moross, Ryan Carson, Simon Collison. They're hitting four UK cities in May and June 2009 to bring you a FREE workshop on "Cloud computing" and an afternoon of web apps and speed networking. Don't miss out.</p>
