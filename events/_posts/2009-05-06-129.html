<p>GeekUp Sheffield takes place on the first Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>This month is the first anniversary of GeekUp in Sheffield. Come and help us celebrate. There'll be plenty of fun and games as well as a talk or two.</p>
<p>We'll also be building the programme for the next year and getting the ball rolling for BashMash 2 (21 May) and BarCamp Sheffield 3 (19-21 June).</p>
