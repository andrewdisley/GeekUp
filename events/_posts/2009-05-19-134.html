<h4>What about Travel?</h4>
<p>Chester station is less than 5 minutes walk away at the end of the road. Free parking is available on City Road adjacent to the venue after 6pm, or if there are no spaces available there then there is always station car park.</p>
<h4>Note - New Venue!</h4>
<p>GeekUp is at the Old Harkers Arms. Harkers is 30 seconds walk from the old City Bar venue. Just cross the road from City Bar and go down the steps next to the canal - Harkers is at the bottom of the steps.</p>
<h4>What if I have another problem?</h4>
