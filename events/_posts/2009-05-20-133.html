<p>We have an action-packed schedule this month with three very cool 20:20s:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Creating iPhone apps with PhoneGap" - Clare Lindley</li>
	<li>"What your BIG-IP can do for you" - Phil Helliwell</li>
	<li>"Hack Spaces, and why having one in Leeds will be awesome" - Jonathan "Squigfried" Powell</li>
</ul>
