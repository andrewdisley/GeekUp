<p>GeekUp Sheffield takes place on the first Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>This month attendees have an exclusive opportunity to snap up tickets for <a class="external" href="http://unsheffield.net/">Unsheffield: Future Users of Cool Technology</a>, this year's flagship grassroots technology happening in Sheffield, before they go on general release. You can also find out about ways to get involved as a blogger, social media surgeon or event volunteer.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the unconference format for Unsheffield, this month's GeekUp is an open house. So, roll up with your own lightning talks, open conversations, show'n'tells and demos, pick a slot and a space, and just go for it :-)</p>
