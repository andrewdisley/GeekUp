<p>GeekUp East Coast was created so that the Creative Types, Developers and Tech folks on the East side of the country had somewhere to get together without braving the Pennines! This is the 2nd Event, and if it's successful, we'll be doing it some more.</p>
<p>GeekUp East Coast events are organised by <a class="external" href="http://switchmac.com/">Rob Hanson</a>.</p>
