<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Venue Change and free pre-registration required, BBQ food option (&pound;5 fee)</strong></p>
<p>This month GeekUp Manchester will not be at the usual venue, instead we have joined forces with <a class="external" href="http://www.manchesterdigital.com/">Manchester Digital</a> and <a href="http://www.northerndigitals.com/">Northern Digitals</a> to bring you the <a class="external" href="http://summerbbq09.eventbrite.com/">Manchester Digital Summer BBQ</a>.</p>
<p>Like all GeekUp's the event is FREE but we ask that you <a class="external" href="http://summerbbq09.eventbrite.com/">pre-register</a> so the venue has an idea of numbers. You can if you want to optionally during registration pay &pound;5 for the BBQ food that will be available during the event.</p>
<p>Manchester events are purely social, come along and have good chinwag.</p>
