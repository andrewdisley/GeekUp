<p>GeekUp Leeds takes place on the third Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>This month event is orgnaised by <a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/squiggle">@Squiggle</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGE OF VENUE</strong>. We've moved temporarily to Mr Foley's as the Lounge terrace is getting a makeover. Regrettably, this means there will be no wheelchair access this month.</p>
<p>We have for you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A 20:20 I've been asked to keep secret (but it's going to be mighty interesting)</li>
	<li>A pep talk from Dom "The Hodge" Hodgson, snappily entitled "Just Bloody Do It"</li>
	<li>Leeds Hack Space fundraiser raffle where we'll be raffling off a brand spanking new iPod touch, an Arduino experimentation kit (courtesy of <a class="external" href="http://oomlout.com/">http://oomlout.com</a>) and one month's membership at the NTI incubator co-working space at Old Broadcasting House.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deb &amp; Rob are soon to be out of action for a while and are looking for your help in organising GeekUp Leeds for the short-term future (either hosting a specific event, or general organisation help appreciated!). Again, please <a class="external" href="http://geekup.org/wiki/index.php?title=OrganiserVolunteersLeeds">let us know</a> if you think you can help out.</p>
