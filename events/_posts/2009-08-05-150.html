<p>GeekUp Sheffield takes place on the first Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Paths</strong> What would your career be like if you managed it in an open source way? Studying Computer Science, Maths or Web Development isn't the only way to get into the technology, creative and digital industries. And qualifying in those areas doesn't lock you into certain roles once you're there.<br><br> This month is a informaton-gathering workshop that kicks off a series on managing your professional career.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong> Open conversations on Swap Shop (Spacemakers) and BashMash (22 August). Plus Shacknet and Geeks In The Peaks announcements.</p>
<p>And maybe an interlude with the Director's Cut of Enter The Dragon at 8.30pm.</p>
