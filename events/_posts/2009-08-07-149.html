<p>GeekUp East Coast was created so that the Creative Types, Developers and Tech folks on the East side of the country had somewhere to get together without braving the Pennines!</p>
<p>Bring your favourite sites, links, hints &amp; tips and share them - we've all picked up loads of new stuff in the first two GeekUp East Coast nights - even found out one of us is a National Competition Level Freefall Parachutist!</p>
<p>For more details get in touch with <a href="mailto:rob@switchmac.com">Rob Hanson</a>.</p>
