<h3>GeekUp Chester is 1 this month!</h3>
<p>This month we'll be following the usual format of beers and chat with a focus on the latest in web development (web fonts anybody?) and general Apple/iPhone chat.  Look out for <a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/bobberridge">@bobberridge</a>'s latest iPhone invention - can he top the hamster powered iPhone hoverboard?
<p>We don't have a reserved location at Harkers so look for a high concentration of iPhones and geek t-shirts.</p>
<p>Alternatively if you can't find us call/text/tweet Dave on 07515 387799 (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/daveverwer">@daveverwer</a>) or Simon on 07980 239350 (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/simon180">@simon180</a>)</p>
<h4>What about Travel?</h4>
<p>Chester station is less than 5 minutes walk away at the end of the road. Free parking is available on City Road adjacent to the venue after 6pm, or if there are no spaces available there then there is always station car park. <a class="external" href="http://j.mp/harkers">Google Map</a></p>
