<p>The usual geekery, and fallout from #bcblackpool. There's absolutely gorgeous food there, but they won't serve it in the snug, so why not arrive early and have your tea? The menu is linked at the bottom of the <a class="external" href="http://www.newcontinental.net/">website</a>. There is also an impressive selection of very good beers and delectable wines!</p>
