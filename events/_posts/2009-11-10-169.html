<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>Venue Change</strong> Due to Revolution double booking us a number of times we've decided to move next door to <a href="http://www.pitcherandpiano.com/locations/bar.cfm?area=Deansgate%20Locks/">Pitcher &amp; Piano</a>, you'll find us in the back room (or ask at the bar for GeekUp).</p>
<p>Like usual <a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/p7r">Paul Robinson</a> should be collecting the USB Drives and redistributing them for <a class="external" href="http://is.gd/2aeN4">GeekUp "MixTape" Shuffle</a>.</p>
