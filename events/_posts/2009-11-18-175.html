<p>GeekUp Leeds takes place on the third Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>We've got some great speakers this week (and lots of good real ale as always). Garrett Coakley is coming up from Oxford's <a class="external" href="http://www.torchbox.com/">Torchbox</a> to tell us about "How To Herd Cats (tips for running a successful online community)" and Ian Bowden, Art Director at <a class="external" href="http://www.rockstarleeds.com/">Rockstar Leeds</a> is coming to talk about living and working in the games industry.</p>
