<p>Tomorrow night we're hosting the second Hebden Bridge Geekup, we skipped December because it fell on the 30th.</p>
<p>The first was a success we had a good turn out. As with the last one, we're still finding our feet so there is no formal agenda or presentations planned. Of course if anyone has anything they want to present or a project they want to talk about drop me a line if you do and we'll sort something out.</p>
<p>Questions, comments etc direct them at me here, on twitter <a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/andrewmccall">@andrewmccall</a> or <a href="mailto:andrew@andrewmccall.com">email</a>.</p>
