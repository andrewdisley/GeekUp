<p><strong>This month we have:</strong> a talk 'Introduction to Version Control': "This talk will be an introduction to using version control to manage projects and collaborate with others. It will cover using common tools and the differences between centralised and distributed systems with examples in Subversion and Git. It will show how to work with and contribute to open source projects using Git and Github."</p>
