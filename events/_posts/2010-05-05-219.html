<p>A first GeekUp for North Staffs &amp; Cheshire, meeting mid-way between Crewe &amp; Stoke-on-Trent to discuss setting up a local hackspace, and for a spot of networking between local Geeks, web professionals, and the technically-curious.</p>
<p>A hackspace is a place where people (artists, techies, &amp; random passers-by) can play creatively with technology - see <a class="external" href="http://nwhackspace.wordpress.com/about/">http://nwhackspace.wordpress.com/about/</a> for more info.</p>
