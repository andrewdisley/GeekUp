<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>MadLab is a bring your own drinks / food venue but there is also an honesty bar if you come empty handed.</p>
<p>Like usual <a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/p7r">Paul Robinson</a> should be collecting the USB Drives and redistributing them for <a class="external" href="http://is.gd/2aeN4">GeekUp "MixTape" Shuffle</a>.</p>
