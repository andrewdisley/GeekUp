<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, (you'll need them). 3345 Parr St is not clearly advertised on the street. Use <a class="external" href="http://is.gd/sVvL">Google StreetView</a> to see the door to the bar. It's next to the Parr St Garage.</p>
<p>This month we'll have a talk from local-boy-done-good Paul Kinlan</p>
<p>Paul Kinlan is a Developer Advocate in Google for Google Chrome. He will be talking about HTML5, Web Standards and the Google Chrome Webstore.</p>
<p><strong>We have to be out by 8pm, as Ed Milliband is using the room!</strong></p>
