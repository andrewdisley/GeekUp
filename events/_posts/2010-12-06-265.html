<p>GeekUp Nottingham takes place on the first Monday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>We've got <a href="http://www.kevinrutherford.co.uk/">Kevin Rutherford </a> talking about "Flow" - releasing more & more often. We also have <a href="http://twitter.com/@dextermixwith">@dextermixwith</a> talking about the trials and tribulations he's found whilst adopting the agile mentality.</p>
