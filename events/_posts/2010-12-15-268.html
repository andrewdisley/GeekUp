<p>GeekUp Leeds takes place on the third Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><strong>For one night only!</strong> - In the season of Bah! Humbug we're shifting across town for the December GeekUpLeeds to the <a class="external" href="http://www.brewerytapleeds.co.uk/">Brewery Tap</a>, New Station St., for an informal gathering - no speakers - no presentations - no nonsense - just chit-chat and beer.</p>
<p>GeekUp Leeds now has it's very own twitter account: <a href="http://twitter.com/GeekUpLeeds">@GeekUpLeeds</a>, go on follow us.</p>
