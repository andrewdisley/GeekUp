<p>GeekUp Chester takes place on the third Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>We don't have a reserved location at Harkers so look for a high concentration of iPhones and geek t-shirts.</p>
<p>Alternatively if you can't find us call/text/tweet Dave on 07515 387799 (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/daveverwer">@daveverwer</a>) or Ross (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/rossjones">@rossjones</a>)</p>
<h4>What about Travel?</h4>
<p>Chester station is less than 5 minutes walk away at the end of the road. Free parking is available on City Road adjacent to the venue after 6pm, or if there are no spaces available there then there is always station car park. <a class="external" href="http://j.mp/harkers">Google Map</a></p>
