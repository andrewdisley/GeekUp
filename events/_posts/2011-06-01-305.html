<p>GeekUp Staffs takes place on the first Wednesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>We're currently meeting in the bar on the right. Look for a table with laptops, iPads, etc., or ask the barstaff where the geeks are ;-)</p>
