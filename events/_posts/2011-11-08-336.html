<p><strong>Next Tuesday is the last* GeekUp Manchester.</strong></p>
<p>GeekUp has been a big part of my life for the last 5 years and 11 months (GeekUp turns 6 in Dec) but the time has come where I can no longer personally commit to organising it.</p>
<p>It would be really great to see many of the originals and many of the mailing list regulars there for a goodbye hug.</p>
<p>It’ll be Upstarts @ The Cornerhouse as Rain Bar stops doing food after 6pm and on occasions kicked us out before 8pm as they’ve closed.</p>
<p>If you can make it along coming sign up at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/cfhrk">http://lanyrd.com/cfhrk</a></p>
<p>Thanks all for helping build and make GeekUp special.</p>
<p>Love <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewdisley">@andrewdisley</a> x</p>
