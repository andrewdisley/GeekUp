<p>At GeekUp Liverpool on Tuesday Paul Freeman will be introducing the game Werewolf to anyone who hasn't played it before and trying to organise a time for a regular meetup. Come along for that and for the usual general geeky chat. There may even be some free beer left over from last week's BarCamp!</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
