<p><strong>Weâ€™ve moved venue</strong> to Cornerhouse, the previous venue stopped serving food after 6pm and randomly closed early a few times.</p>
<p>GeekUp Manchester takes place on the second Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
