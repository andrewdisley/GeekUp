<p>This month's GeekUp follows on from John McKerrell's talk about OpenStreetMap at the recent Social Media Cafe.</p>
<p>So, OpenStreetMap, we've featured the project before at GeekUp and coverage in Liverpool is looking pretty good, there's still lots to do though! Bring a laptop and John will get you started editing if you haven't done it before. We'll set some objectives and try to get some comprehensive coverage of points of interest and building outlines.</p>
<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>If you want to drink at the event you need to bring your own refreshment, there's a Tesco just up the road and lots more shops slightly further away in town.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
