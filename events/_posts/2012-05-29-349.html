<p>This month Simon Holgate (<a href="http://twitter.com/SimonHolgate">@SimonHolgate</a>) will give a talk titled "Clojure and my first months with ClojureScript".</p>
<p>He'll give a quick introduction to the Clojure language (it's lisp based, functional and runs on the JVM, CLR and Python VM - kinda!). He'll then spend most of my time talking about ClojureScript which is a relatively new project running Clojure on the Javascript engine allowing Clojure on the server and in the browser.</p>
<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>If you want to drink at the event you need to bring your own refreshment, there's a Tesco just up the road and lots more shops slightly further away in town.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
