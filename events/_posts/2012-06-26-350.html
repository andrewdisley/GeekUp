<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>This month:</p>
<h3>Security testing for developers; Because being hacked sucks.</h3>
<blockquote>
With recent expensive security breaches at Sony, LinkedIn and Linode, security should be a priority for any developer. The problem is that security testing can be a confusing, opaque realm. This talk aims to provide a language and platform agnostic tutorial on the fundamentals of web application security testing.
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to drink at the event you need to bring your own refreshment, there's a Tesco just up the road and lots more shops slightly further away in town.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
