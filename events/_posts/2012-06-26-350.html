<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p><em>Currently there is no talk planned, meaning we'll just have a social in the pub.</em></p>
<p>We'll be meeting in the Shipping Forecast after work, aiming
to be there by 7pm at the latest. Hope to see you there!</p>
