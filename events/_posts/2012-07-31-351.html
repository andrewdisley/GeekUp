<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Jam!</h3>
<p>This month is all about the <em>Raspberry Pi</em>. Got one? Bring it along and show off what you've done with it or find help getting going. Never seen one? Come along and find out what they're all about!</p
<p>If you want to drink at the event you need to bring your own refreshment, there's a Tesco just up the road and lots more shops slightly further away in town.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
