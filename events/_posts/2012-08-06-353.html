<p>This month, in partnership with the Nottingham Open Data Group (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/NottsOpenData">@NottsOpenData</a>), David Vernau, GIS Technical Co-ordinator at Nottingham City Council will be talking to us about their Open Data plan and getting your thoughts and ideas on the way forward. It promises to be a lively discussion on a subject many of us are passionate about and it's a great opportunity to make your voice heard on how your council shares its data.</p><p>After that, your host Andrew Seward (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/MrAndrew">@MrAndrew</a>) will run some <a class="external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Innovation-Games-Creating-Breakthrough-Collaborative/dp/0321437292">Innovation Games</a> to map out a plan for the future of Geekup Nottingham and our vision for a collaborative, self-sustaining Nottingham tech community.
