<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>GeekUp Liverpool August will be a lazy social. Let's just go to the pub!</p>

<p>We'll be meeting in the Shipping Forecast after work, aiming
to be there by 7pm at the latest. Hope to see you there!</p>
