<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>

<h3>Clojure Dojo</h3>

<p>We hope to be having a short talk from Steven Citron-Pousty (<a href="http://twitter.com/TheSteve0">@TheSteve0</a>),
a Developer Advocate for RedHat about deploying Clojure apps on OpenShift
(<a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">https://openshift.redhat.com/app/</a>) .
</p>

<p>Simon Holgate has introduced the main dojo as follows:

<blockquote>
Given the lack of Clojure experience among us (I'm hardly a guru!), I'm going to suggest that we look at 4clojure (<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/">http://www.4clojure.com/</a>) so everyone can code.
<br><br>
No development environment is required but if anyone wants help setting one up I'll be around from 18.00. I use Emacs with nrepl but YMMV. There are also environments for Vim, Eclipse and IntelliJ 9as well as possible others).
<br><br>
Hope to see you all then!
</blockquote>

<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
