<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>

<h3>Colin Wright</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ColinTheMathmo">Colin</a> has a PhD in mathematics and is now perhaps best known for the presentation Juggling: Theory and Practice.</p>

<p>Subject of Colin's talk is to be determined &ldquo;but probably something like: "Linear Algebra.  What?" &rdquo;</p>

<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
