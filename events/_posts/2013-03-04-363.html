<p>This month Geekup Nottingham presents two short talks from professionals in the technology industry around Nottingham and the Geekup Retrospective.</p>
<p><h3>An Introduction to Secure Coding</h3>Your code works, it's fast, it's well documented and it passes all the tests. But is it secure? Coding securely is becoming increasingly important as cyber attacks grow in frequency and severity. Colin Powers (<a href="http://twitter.com/colinmpowers">@colinmpowers</a>) is a former Cyber Security Challenge finalist and a Software Engineer for Nexor (<a href="http://www.nexor.com/">www.nexor.com</a>), a company with customers in Government, Defence and Critical National Infrastructure.<br />Colin will cover why you need to care about secure coding, what you need to do to make sure you are coding securely, and look at the specific examples of software vulnerabilities: integer overflows and SQL injections.</p>
<p><h3>Dealing with Clients</h3>LucyHG (<a href="http://twitter.com/lucyhg">@LucyHG</a>) co-founder, designer and project manager of Nottingham-based mobile app development firm <a href="http://www.kukuapps.com">Kuku Apps</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/KukuApps">@KukuApps</a>) guides us through dealing with clients, based on her experiences at Kuku.<br/>Their work was recently featured in a great article in the Guardian, take a look: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/feb/18/distance-learning-through-technology">http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/feb/18/distance-learning-through-technology</a>.</p>
