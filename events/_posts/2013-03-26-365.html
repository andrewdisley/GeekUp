<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>

<h3>Joy</h3>

<p>Just back from his world tour of Neasden, our very own Francis Fish will present a short talk on the Joy Programming language and why it's nice to tie your brain in knots.
<p>Joy doesn't have parameters, it doesn't have methods, it uses combinators to do its work.</p>
<p>If you think you know how to calculate a factorial, think again.</p>

<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
