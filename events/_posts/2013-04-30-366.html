<p>It's the sixth anniversary of GeekUp Liverpool this month so we're doing something a little different. We'd like as many people as possible to turn up and give a 5 minute talk on a project they've worked on in the last 6 years.</p>

<p>It can be the best project or the worst, the most fun or the most stressful. Just pick some project that was notable to you and that you think we'll be interested to hear about. I think BarCamp rules apply in that everybody turning up should give a talk (but, go on then, we won't be too upset if you don't, the more the merrier after all!)</p>

<p>If you're coming then please add yourself onto this lanyard page:</p>

<p>http://lanyrd.com/2013/geekup-liverpool/</p>

<p>Feel free to add yourself as a speaker and even add your talk to the line-up (or not if you haven't figured out what you're talking about).</p>

<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>

<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
