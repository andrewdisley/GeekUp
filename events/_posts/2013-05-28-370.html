<p>This month we have Francis Irving, CEO of ScraperWiki, coming to talk to us:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Can we liberate data from applications, and let anyone work with 
their information in the way they want?
    </p><p>
Francis introduces ScraperWiki's new platform - both the tools
that anyone can use, and the more powerful and standard backend
for developers and data scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>

<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
