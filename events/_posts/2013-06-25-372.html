<h3>Geeks Mean Business</h3>
<p>This month is business month. We'll be having a selection of Liverpool's most successful geeks (maybe) coming to tell you about their experience of setting up and running a business. If you'd be interested in talking then get in touch, we're hoping for 3-4 talks in total of around 15-20 minutes.</p>
<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>

<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
