<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>mm.. <del>beer</del> mead!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This month is all about the beer, or more accurately mead.</p>
<p>
Brewing is a really simple hobby. We'll be talking through the equipment and process of home brewing, whilst setting up a barrel of Krigsmj&ouml;d, a beer type war-mead that will brew in DoES for a few weeks, to be ready to drink or bottle during the next month's GeekUp. And of course, I'll bring a sample of a previous brew to taste!
</p><p>
Krigsmj&ouml;d is a fast brewing, beer style mead. Ready to drink in 4 weeks, it's the most reliable brewing recipe that I've come across and it's reeeally drinkable. Almost dangerously so!

<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
