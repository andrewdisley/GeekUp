<p>Join some of the best programmers in Nottingham as they show off the languages and features that make them so productive.</p>
 <p>This month Graham Haythornthwaite (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/the_big_gh">@the_big_gh</a>) will be hosting a programming language showcase.  A number of small programming challenges will be set and then we'll spend some time reflecting on the different ways that these have been solved.</p>
 <p>We normally have experts in C#, Java, Ruby, Python and JavaScript to name a few, but we are always keen to look at other languages if that is your preference.  However, this event isn't just for the experts, it is open to programmers of all abilities.  Want to learn a couple of advanced language features or get a better appreciation of what other languages you could be using?  Then this is the place to be!</p>
 <p>The challenges will be solved in small teams in your favourite programming environment so if you have a laptop please bring it along already setup and with <a class="external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">Git installed</a>.</p>
