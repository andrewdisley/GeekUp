Web scraping is a useful tool to be in any software developer's toolkit, but it's a hard skill to learn. Enter RSWA - 'Really Scrapable Web App'. It's a web app that makes it easy to learn the skills needed to take information and put it in a format that is easy to manipulate and analyze. This talk will gently introduce it, as well as some concepts in web scraping.
