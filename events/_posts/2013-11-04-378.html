<p>This month Andrew Bullock (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/trullock">@trullock</a>) presents <b>Website Performance Is a Feature</b></p>
<p>The performance of your website is critical to customer engagement and conversion.
There are many factors that can affect your website's performance, from TCP/TLS negotiation to CSS efficiency. 
In this talk Andrew will be covering all the theory with plenty of practical advice for you to put in place on your own sites. 
There will also be a practical workshop where Andrew will teach your how to use various tools to analyse performance and some exercises to practice on.
- Bring your laptops and have Google Chrome installed!</p>
<p>There'll also be <b>Free Beer</b> (or whatever is your tipple) available courtesy of <a class="external" href="http://www.cordius.co.uk/">Cordius</a></p>
