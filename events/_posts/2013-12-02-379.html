<p>This month we have two short talks, a programming challenge (bring laptops!) and <b>FREE BEER</b> (or whatever your tipple may be) available courtesy of <a class="external" href="http://www.cordius.co.uk/">Cordius</a>.</p>
<h2>Actor based concurrency</h2>
<p>Tim Barker presents An introduction to the Actor Model and how it helps build concurrent systems without threads and locks with one or two short examples using Akka.</p>
<h2>How do software teams learn?</h2>
<p>How do you and your software team learn new technologies and techniques? How can software teams organize learning? How can software teams build learning cultures? Charles Armitage (<a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/cjra_anomia">@cjra_anomia</a>) will describe how a learning culture has been built at Red Box Recorders including its successes and failings. We hope to provoke a discussion share how teams approach learning. And of course we would love to hear from you lone gun developers too!</p>
<h2>Programming Challenge</h2>
<p>We'll be stretching our programming legs with a programming challenge, details of which will be shared at the event. Bring a laptop with your favourite dev environment if you can.</p>
