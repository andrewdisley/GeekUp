<br/><h1>Get Creative in 2014</h1>
<p>Our first Geekup Nottingham of 2014 is all about the making! We have three talks on the theme of creating software, and <b>FREE BEER</b> (or whatever your tipple may be) courtesy of <a class="external" href="http://www.cordius.co.uk/">Cordius</a>.</p>
<h2>Development’s the easy bit</h2>
<div class="speakerdesc"><a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/adambird">Adam Bird</a> - Founder of <a class="external" href="http://www.onediary.com">OneDiary</a></div>
<p>"How do you turn an app idea into a business? I can’t claim to have turned One Diary into a business quite yet but in this talk I’ll take you through what we’ve done to get it ready for people to use. I’ll include information and experience of company structure & formation, promotional tools and services I’ve used to fast-track delivery as much as possible."</p>
<h2>Deploying and running your web apps in 2014</h2>
<div class="speakerdesc"><a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/neilkilbride">Neil Kilbride</a> - Development Team Lead at <a class="external" href="http://www.esendex.co.uk">Esendex</a></div>
<p>In this talk, Neil highlights and demonstrates how PaaS offerings make creating software easier than ever, allowing developers to deploy and run web applications on demand, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the many different available platforms.</p>
<h2>Sprat - the Spreadsheet API Tester</h2>
<div class="speakerdesc"><a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/jhigman">Julian Higman</a> - Director of Functionize</div>
<p>"How do you allow non-programming users to set up and run tests against your system?
If you've got an API that can expose your systems functionality, then you could use Sprat. 
Sprat allows tests to be written as rows in a spreadsheet, and then runs those tests against a specified API, updating the spreadsheet with results. 
It's implemented as an open source Ruby project, with some Google Script to integrate with spreadsheets in Google Drive. 
I'll talk about why we created it, how it works, what its limitations are. And I'll be asking if other people are doing similar things, and whether there are ways to make it better."</p>
<b>About Geekup Nottingham</b><p>GeekUp Nottingham takes place on the first Monday of every month.
