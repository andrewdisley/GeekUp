<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Redecentralization with Francis Irving, co-founder of <a href="http://Redecentralize.org">Redecentralize.org</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quietly a few geeks are decentralizing the Internet again.
</p><p>
Distributed hash trees, mesh networks, crypto currencies.
</p><p>
Who are they? Why are they doing it? What are the technologies?
</p><p>
We'll end with a group discussion as to why - if! - we care in Liverpool. Privacy? Resilience? Competition? Or even just that computers don't seem fun and more.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
