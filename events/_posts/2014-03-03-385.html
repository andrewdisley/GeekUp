<p>Another great talk and practical this month, and <b>FREE BEER</b> (or whatever your tipple may be) available courtesy of <a class="external" href="http://www.cordius.co.uk/">Cordius</a>.</p>
<h2>Robot Games, A Retrospective</h2>
<p>Peter Cooper presents a quick tour of the long history of robot-based programming games, not only looking at how they work and how they've evolved, but also how you can have fun with them yourself. Then, a short practical session where you'll get the opportunity to build your own robots and pitch them against those of other attendees will follow.</p>
<p>Peter Cooper (<a class="external" href="http://peterc.org/">peterc.org</a>) is a programmer, publisher, and chair of <a class="external" href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014">O'Reilly's Fluent conference</a>. He wrote <a class="external" href="http://beginningruby.org/">Beginning Ruby</a>, published by Apress, and is perhaps best known for running <a class="external" href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a> in the Ruby and Rails world.</p>
