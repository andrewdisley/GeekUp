<p>Another great talk and practical this month, and <b>FREE BEER</b> (or whatever your tipple may be) available courtesy of <a class="external" href="http://www.cordius.co.uk/">Cordius</a>.</p>
<h2>Inspiring Coders</h2>
<p>How old do you need to be to code? What is the best age to discovery your ‘talent’?</p>
<p>In this talk Phil Wheldon (<a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/PhilWheldon">@PhilWheldon</a>) be sharing his experiences of running a <a class="external" href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a>, what’s involved and the benefits that volunteering brings. He'll also be running a code club session with the Geekup audience so you can see if you too can program like a ten year old.</p>
<h2>An Agile Retrospective</h2>
<p>The retrospective is one of the most important elements of any Agile development process, it is a mechanism for celebrating successes, acknowledging failures and then improving and optimising. Andrew Seward (<a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/MrAndrew">@MrAndrew</a>) will demonstrate the power of the retrospective by running a retro session on the Geekup event itself.</p>
