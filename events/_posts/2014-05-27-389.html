<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>GeekUp does Maker Night</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This month we're sharing with Maker Night - the hardware hacking night at DoES Liverpool. Come along to meet the Makers in the Liverpool community and see what 3D printing and laser cutting is all about.
</p><p>
There won't be any particular schedule to this evening so drop in when you can, Maker Night generally has a short introduction around 7:30pm for anyone who's new to the workshop.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
