<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Summer Social!</h3>
<p>This month we're just going to the pub. Meet at DoES Liverpool between 6pm-6:30pm. We'll then wander over to The Brink on Parr St for some food. Afterwards, say 7:30pm - 8pm we'll go back down the hill to The Kazimier Garden for a drink or two.</p>
<h3>Next Month - Liverpool Girl Geeks</h3>
<p>Next month we hope to have someone from <a href="https://twitter.com/lpoolgirlgeeks">Liverpool Girl Geeks</a> coming to talk to us about their <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/liverpool-girl-geeks-wearable-technologies-tickets-11294083909?aff=estw">Wearable Technologies "Bring and Brag" session</a> went.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
