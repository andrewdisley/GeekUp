<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Learn how you can start and run your business smarter in the Cloud.</h3>
<p>Daniel Pala, founder of design agency Libero Net and mobilizer of Elance, will be holding a workshop to show you how to kickstart your startup while keeping your business lean, smart and cost effective. You will learn how to source the best talent in the cloud and build a virtual or hybrid organisation. Freelancers will learn how to win work/ projects on the platform.
</p><p>
Before and after the workshop there will be time to have some drinks and snacks; chat and network. Elance offers all participants of the event $50 credits to spend on its platform.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
