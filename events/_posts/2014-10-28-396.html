<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Exploring The Depths with Javascript - Barry Getty</h3>
<p>Underwater exploration is one area that has remained firmly within the realm of highly funded organisations and institutions. Recently, however, with increasing access to low cost drone and RC vehicle electronics and microcontrollers, hobbyists and smaller, less well funded, organisations are able to research and explore the depths.
</p><p>
Over the past few months we've been experimenting, designing and developing new open-source hardware and software to enable people to explore beneath the waves as cheaply as possible. Hopefully in this talk I'll go through the hassles and annoyances, where we went wrong (a lot), where we are now and what we're planning for the future. The focus will be on which technology we found the most helpful and what delayed us longer than it should have.</p>
<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
