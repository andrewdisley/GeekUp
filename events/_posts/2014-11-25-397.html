<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Space on a budget? - Chris Atherton</h3>
<p>High altitude ballooning and the Liverpool company aiming for the stars. 
</p><p>
OK, first thing; it's not quite space.  Space starts at around 100 km.  Still, 30 km up is not to be sniffed at.  We talk about the highs and lows of high altitude ballooning, or HABs for short.  Using an arduino, a GPS receiver and a licence exempt radio transmitter Chris Atherton from Route to Space Ltd will talk through how you could launch your own high altitude balloon project and what is next for his Liverpool based company.</p>
<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
