<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Elm - Claudia Doppislash</h3>
<p>A Functional Reactive Programming language that targets the web (Javascript, Html, CSS).
</p><p>
Reactive Programming has gotten in the mainstream with the Microsoft
Rx extensions, it's basically a better abstraction for anything that
requires interactivity, like GUIs and games.
</p><p>
No callback hell, no null pointer errors, it's got a Time Travelling
debugger and hot code swapping.
</p><p>
The time travelling debugger is inspired by the talk "Inventing of
Principle" by Bret Victor ( <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a> )
</p>
<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
