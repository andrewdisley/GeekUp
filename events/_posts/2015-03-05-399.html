<p>GeekUp Manchester is on the first Thursday of every odd month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<p>This month we're moving to Terrace Bar in the Northern Quarter. It's not far from the old location. Food is served and you can order it to a table in our private room upstairs. Follow <a class="external" href="http://twitter.com/mcrgeekup">@mcrgeekup</a> for any last minute updates.</p>
