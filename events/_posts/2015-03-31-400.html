<p>GeekUp Liverpool takes place on the last Tuesday of every month. It's a grass-roots knowledge sharing and networking social for folks involved or interested in all forms of technology and creative media.</p>
<h3>Life's A Pitch, And Then A Technology Journalist Laughs At You - <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewhughes">Matthew Hughes</a></h3>
<p>My talk will discuss how best to approach technology writers to get coverage of your idea, and will showcase examples where it's gone horribly wrong.</p>
</p>
<p>DoES Liverpool provides tea &amp; coffee, feel free to bring your own beer or if you forget someone else will share with you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong>, Gostins Building is at the opposite end of Hanover Street from Liverpool Central Station, near to John Lewis  and the corner with Duke Street. Go up in the lifts to the fourth floor and follow the signs to DoES Liverpool.</p>
