				<h2>What are the Fresh Digital &amp; Media Awards 2009?</h2>
				<p>The <a href="http://www.freshdigitalawards.co.uk/">Fresh Digital Awards</a> have continued to go from strength to strength and each year we adopt a format to keep the awards up to date and well....fresh. This year is no exception with brand new categories and a newly combined format to incorporate the Fresh Media Awards so 2009 will be the best year yet.</p>
				<p>Once again we have an easy on-line entry system, in addition to the same high standards of judging – which has always been impeccable.</p>
				<p>Designed to make your budgets stretch just that little bit further too, we have also ditched the traditional sit down, black tie dinner for a new, less formal approach. The awards will take place on Wednesday 30 September at the Odeon in The Printworks and will be followed by a huge party afterwards at Tiger Tiger.</p>
				<p>With reduced entry fees, and ticket prices, the time to gain some much needed exposure and promotion is now – and what’s more – you have until July to start thinking up some truly Fresh ideas for entries.</p>
				<p>And if you need any more inspiration for entering this year then a note from our Digital chair of the judges, <strong>James Hilton of AKQA</strong>:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>"Stock market crashes, record unemployment, knife-wielding 8 year olds, and swine flavored killer flu. The world has officially gone to shit. Thank the Lord then for the Fresh awards – that beacon of light shining forth with its promise of shiny things to adorn mantelpieces, or at the very least keep that door open. So enter now and be merry, for tomorrow you quite possibly will be penniless and jobless. And dead. With a cold."</p>
